Welcome to the review of my readable project.

The readable project needs the backend server supplied by udacity.

Please make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine.

Please create a project folder (directoy) on your machine

Open a terminal session to that project folder.

Please enter:

```git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter```

please then go into that directory

```cd reactnd-project-readable-starter```

enter the following command to install external npm modules

```npm install```

once the npm finishes and the command prompt return please enter

```npm start```

to start the server the project I have built will be using.

If all went well the following message should appear

__Server listening on port 5001, Ctrl+C to stop__

We will now install the readable project I have built.

Please open another terminal session in the project folder (directory) you
cloned the server.

Please enter:

```git clone https://github.com/netlogic/brets-readable-project.git```

please then go into that directory

```cd brets-readable-project```

enter the following command to install external npm modules

```npm install```

once the npm finishes and the command prompt return please enter

```npm start```

If all has gone well you can now browse to the following location
to start using the project.
