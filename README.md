Welcome to the review of my readable project.

The readable project needs the backend server supplied by udacity.

Please make sure you have node and npm installed on your machine.

Please create a project folder (directoy) on your machine

Open a terminal session to that project folder.

Please enter:

```git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter```

please then go into that directory

```cd reactnd-project-readable-starter```

enter the following command to install external npm modules

```npm install```

once the npm finishes and the command prompt return please enter

```npm start```

to start the server the project I have built will be using.

If all went well the following message should appear

__Server listening on port 5001, Ctrl+C to stop__

We will now install the readable project I have built.


Please open another terminal session in the project folder (directory) you
cloned the server.

To get the source code you have two options:

1. Unzip the file sent with this project in the project folder

2. download the source via git
  Steps for git download are simply:

  ```git clone https://github.com/netlogic/brets-readable-project.git```

please then go into the directory brets-readable-project

```cd brets-readable-project```

enter the following command to install external npm modules

```npm install```

once the npm finishes and the command prompt return please enter

```npm start```

If all has gone well you can now browse to the following location
to start using the project.

A lot of this project follows the structure of reactjs/redux
I found it very clean and URLS were supported.
That repository can be found at:
```https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/v3.6.0/examples/real-world/src/index.js```
This blog spot about react-redux-router also was guiding me.
```https://blog.marvelapp.com/managing-the-url-in-a-redux-app/```

uuids for items records are created via package:
node-uuid https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid

 As I suck at CSS I have been building a large number of my apps with react-native-web
 For best display please user chrome as I have not tested the presentation of
 my app on other browsers.  Unfortunately flex-box screws up and normally
 hacks need to be implemented so presentation is improved on IE and FireFox.
